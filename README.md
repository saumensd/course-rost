React state management:
-There are many ways to manage state in React
. Here are some of the most popular options:
Local state:
Local state is managed within a single component. It is the simplest and most straightforward way to manage state, and it is often the best option for small components. To manage local state, you can use the useState hook.
Global state:
Global state is managed across multiple components. It is a more complex option than local state, but it is necessary for larger applications. There are a number of different global state management libraries available, such as Redux, MobX, and Context API.
Server state:
Server state is managed on the server. It is the most complex option, but it is the best option for applications that need to be highly scalable. To manage server state, you can use a database or a cache.

# React + Vite 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
